This repo is created for the Kaggle competition: [San Francisco crime classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/leaderboard).

The gradient boosted tree algorithm performed well with the data (2.41228 multi-logloss with the test data). Because of the run-time issue, I stopped the cross validation at 50 iteration, in which the cv error was still decreasing. 

Final versions with visualizations: [suicide](http://rpubs.com/fhlgood/sfsuicide), [robbery](http://rpubs.com/fhlgood/sfrv).
